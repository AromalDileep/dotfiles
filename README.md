# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, managed using **GNU Stow**.
The goal is to keep all configuration files version-controlled, modular,
and easily reproducible across systems.

This is a **private repository**, intended purely for my own reference and
understanding.

---

## Why GNU Stow

GNU Stow is used to manage dotfiles via **symbolic links** instead of copying
files into `$HOME`.

Advantages:
- Single source of truth for all configs
- Easy to add/remove entire config groups
- Clean `$HOME` (no duplicated files)
- Safe to version control
- Reversible at any time

Stow never edits files — it only creates or removes symlinks.

---

## Repository Layout

Each **top-level directory** is a *Stow package*.
A package mirrors the directory structure **relative to `$HOME`**.

Example structure:
```
.dotfiles/
├── ideavim
│   └── .ideavimrc
├── kitty
│   └── .config
│       └── kitty
│           └── kitty.conf
├── README.md
├── starship
│   └── .config
│       └── starship.toml
├── tmux
│   └── .tmux.conf
└── zsh
    └── .zshrc
```

What this means:
- `zsh/.zshrc`
  → `$HOME/.zshrc`
- `kitty/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`
  → `$HOME/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`

Stow automatically creates the required parent directories and symlinks.

---

## How Stow Works (Important)

When you run:
```bash
stow kitty
```

Stow:
1. Reads the `kitty/` directory
2. Interprets paths **relative to `$HOME`**
3. Creates symlinks in `$HOME`
4. Points those symlinks back to this repository

Example result:
```
~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf -> ~/.dotfiles/kitty/.config/kitty/kitty.conf
```

The **real file lives in `.dotfiles`**.
`$HOME` only contains symlinks.

---

## Usage

### Initial setup
```bash
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

### Stow specific packages
```bash
stow zsh
stow kitty
```

You can stow multiple packages at once:
```bash
stow zsh kitty
```

---

### Remove symlinks (unstow)

To remove symlinks created by a package:
```bash
stow -D zsh
stow -D kitty
```

This:
* Removes symlinks from `$HOME`
* Does **not** delete any files inside `.dotfiles`

---

## Typical Workflow

1. Edit files **inside `.dotfiles`**
2. Symlinks update automatically
3. Reload or restart the application (or use live reload if supported)
4. Commit changes to git

Never edit the symlinked files in `$HOME` directly — always edit the real files
inside `.dotfiles`.

---

## Kitty Configuration Notes

Kitty configuration is modular.

Typical setup:
```
kitty/
└── .config/kitty/
    ├── kitty.conf      # root config
    ├── theme.conf      # active theme include
    ├── keybindings.conf
    └── themes/         # kitty-themes repository
```

`kitty.conf` acts as the entry point and includes other files using:
```conf
include theme.conf
include keybindings.conf
```

Themes are switched by modifying `theme.conf`, not `kitty.conf`.

---

## Safety Notes

* Do **not** run `stow` from outside `~/.dotfiles`
* Always `cd ~/.dotfiles` before running stow
* Avoid filename conflicts between packages
* Use `stow -n <package>` for a dry run if unsure

---

## System Assumptions

This setup assumes:
* Linux
* `$HOME`-based configuration
* GNU Stow installed
* Zsh as shell
* Kitty as terminal emulator

---

## Purpose of This Repository

* Personal system reproducibility
* Learning and understanding Linux configuration
* Clean separation of concerns
* Long-term maintainability

This is **not** meant to be a public or generic dotfiles repo.
It is optimized for my workflow and preferences.
